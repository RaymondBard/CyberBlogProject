        <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I'm Raymond!</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my blog! I have currently made this blog because it will be the first project of my cyber security bootcamp. I am a 20 year old
            aspiring Cyber Security Professional. As I have previously mentioned I am taking a cyber security bootcamp through the University of Connecticut
            and this blog will showcase some of the skills I have learned.

                <h3>The Big Question of Ransomware</h3>
                <h4>Ransomware</h4>
                <p>
                   One of the biggest question surrounding ransomware is, Should organizations pay the ransomware or not? My answer to this is they should absolutely not pay the ransom.
                   To explain my reasoning let me tell you a story. In 2020 before Covid my highschool, in my senior year, was hit with an awful ransomware attack. It was terrible, The school 
                   had shut down the wifi and we were warned not to use it in risk we might get the virus and horror stories arose of teachers loving 15 years worth of lesson plans that they worked so hard
                   for. The entire school was plunged into the dark ages, a time before computers, everything was done the old school way. The kicker was that it was revealed later that the attackers originally
                   attacked back in the summer of 2019 and the school had paid them for the stolen files but eventually the bad actors attacked again anyway. So no, people should not pay ransomware attackers.

                <h3>Security vs Business</h3>
                <h4>Security</h4>
                <p>
                    Within any large business there is bound to be tension between the executive part of the business and the security department. The reason for this tension is that one party wants to 
                    quickly create and deploy new applications to their customers and the other wants to slow down this process the make sure everything is secure before rolling out a new product;
                    this leads to the question who should have have the final say on product security decisions, the business or the security department? I understand both sides, the executive side wants 
                    to be ahead of their competition, be the first ones to give their customers something the others can not and sometimes that means they are willing to sacrifice security for it. 
                    On the other hand, the security department is more than willing to sacrifice rolling an application as long as they need to to be able to make sure whatever they company made is secure.
                    In the end, the security department should have final say on a product because if a product gets rolled out without it being sufficiently secure the user of the product might get hacked
                    and lose valuable information, leading to a loss of customers leading to the company losing money or, the company might get hacked leading to the company losing money as well.
                    Either way the security department should have the final say on a product which, as a benefit, will save the company an untold amount of money.
